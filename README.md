DRAFT version of autocomplete. Still a work in progress.  Some commands may not be fully available with all parameters.


Provides auto-complete for `tsh` and `tctl`.  Note this has been confirmed just with `8.1.4` tsh in zsh.  See the goteleport.com/docs for more information on Teleport and the `tsh` client.

Add the below to your `.zshrc` or where you prefer to store your autocompletes.  Please submit any bugs or desired features.

```zsh
source <path>/tsh/tshcomplete.zsh
source <path>/tctl/tctlcomplete.zsh
```
